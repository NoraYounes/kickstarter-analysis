# Kickstarting Analysis
## Overview of Project
The project’s goal was to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, plan her own crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever by mirroring successful ones. Since Fever’s campaign came close to reaching its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, Louise wanted further insight on the relationships between campaigns, their launch dates and funding goals. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to analyze Outcomes Based on Launch Date, a line chart was created showing the outcomes for theater campaigns by month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In order to analyze Outcomes Based on Goals, a line chart was created showing the outcomes for plays based on dollar-amount ranges for goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During the analysis for Outcomes Based on Goals, there was no data for canceled campaigns in the subcategory plays thus it limits the analysis for that particular outcome. However, since this could also indicate that campaigns for plays are more stable and promising resulting in campaigns completing their fundraising period it does not impact the overall analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals.
## Results
The month of May had the most successful theater campaigns launched. The period from May to August and the month of October experienced approximately the same number of failed theater campaigns launched. 
The most successful campaigns had a goal under $5,000, with 73% with a goal between $1,000 to $4,999 and 76% with a goal less than $1,000.  The least successful campaigns had a goal between $25,000 to $34,999 or greater than $45,000. 
A limitation of the dataset is that the Launch Dates analysis does not consider the length of campaigns and whether that is a factor that would impact outcomes. Another limitation is that a few campaigns have a significantly higher goal which may skew the data.  
A way to address the first limitation is to calculate the campaign length and create another line graph to display outcomes by campaign length then compare it to the outcomes by month launched graph. A way to address the second limitation is to generate a summary statistics table and then create a box plot to identify outliers that may be skewing the data.
